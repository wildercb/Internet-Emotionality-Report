# Internet-Emotionality-Report
Skimming through reddits history to determine the different vibes of the internet over the past decade. 

# Final Project for COS 482 Intro To Data Science under Dr. Chen for the Univerity of Maine.
In this repository I intend to work with the The Wayback Machine Scraper https://github.com/sangaline/wayback-machine-scraper to scrape the titles of reddit post for the past decade. These titles will be stored ____ and indexed ____ by their date and day of the week.
For a query that can pull titles of post over any given period of time or day of weeks for any given period of time we can take advantage of the textBlob sentiment analysis python package to gather a sense of the polarity and subjectivity of reddit posts and the average of those within the query.
From here we can visualize a sense of if the internet has been more or less emotional in comparison of different time frames, such as 2018 vs 2021 or tuesdays in 2015-17 were more subjective but less polarized than those on wednesdays in December 2021 or perhaps it is the opposite.
This could be achieved say by graphing on a matplotlib line graph the average titles text sentiment per day in the query over a sequence of days in line with those of another query being able to see trends and making overall comparisons between the one or two or more graphs.
